# roomba_ros2_driver

A ROS2 node for controlling iRobot Roomba robots. This package subscribes to velocity command messages (`geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`) and translates them into commands that the Roomba can understand and execute.

## Features

- Listens to ROS2 velocity commands (`/cmd_vel`)
- Translates and sends commands to the Roomba robot
- Designed for integration with other ROS2 navigation and control stacks

## Setupo
- ros2 jazzy base
- rpi5
- ubunut 24.04 server
additional ros2 packages
-  sudo apt install ros-jazzy-tf-transformations

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```

2. **Build the package:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws
   colcon build --packages-select roomba_ros2_driver
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

3. **Launch the node:**

   - **Directly:**
     ```bash
     ros2 run roomba_ros2_driver roomba_ros2_driver_node
     ```

   - **Using the launch file:**
     ```bash
     ros2 launch roomba_ros2_driver roomba_ros2_driver.launch.py
     ```

4. **Send velocity commands:**
   Publish to the `/cmd_vel` topic using `ros2 topic pub` or your own ROS2 navigation stack:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.2, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.5}}"
   ```

   You can also control the robot interactively using the [teleop_twist_keyboard](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard) package:
      1. Install the package:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
      ```
      2. Run the node:
      ```bash
      ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
      ```
   This will send velocity commands to `/cmd_vel` using your keyboard.

## Requirements

- ROS2 (tested on Foxy/Humble)
- Compatible Roomba robot (with appropriate serial or USB interface)

## TODO

- [ ] Fix the TODOs in the code
- [ ] Create TF tree
- [ ] Compute odometry out of provided sensor data
- [ ] Create URDF model that can be used for Simulation (using Fusion 360)
